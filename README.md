📌 How It Works

1. Geolocation: Fetches the user's current position using the navigator.geolocation API.


2. TLE Data: Uses hardcoded TLE (Two-Line Element) data for each satellite.


3. Position Calculation: Satellite positions are updated every 3 seconds using satellite.js.


4. Mapping:

Satellite locations are plotted with animated trails.

Clicking on a satellite shows:

Location (Lat, Lng)

Altitude

Speed

Weather at location

Speed chart (last 20 data points)




5. Filtering: Users can toggle which satellites are shown using checkboxes.
